/* This is the "pseudocode" for our evaluation function

Assign piece values: 

Pawn = 1
Knight = 3
Bishop = 3
Rook = 5
Queen = 9
*Multiply all of these values by some factor

"Score": Sum of white piece values - Sum of black piece values

Controlling center squares is better than not controlling center squares
  If a piece attacks e4, e5, d4, d5 (add/subtract x value to score)
  
Attacking enemy pieces is better than not attacking enemy pieces
  If a piece attacks an enemy piece but can't be disadvantageously taken in the very next move (add/subtract x value to score)
  
Bishops controlling diagonals are good
  If a bishop controls a diagonal that has <=2 pawns on it (a "good" diagonal) (add/subtract x value to score)
  If both bishops of one player control "good" diagonals (add/subtract 2x + y value to score)
  
King safety is extremely important
  If the king is in the center while queens are still on the board (add/subtract x value to score)
  If the king is castled (add/subtract x value to score)
